# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code that we can call or invoke to do something.

  Researched answer: "In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword."



2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() will return a new array with that will have different or new elements that were made to the original array. .filter() will return specific values request from they array without altering the original array. 
  Researched answer: The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. The filter method is well suited for particular instances where the user must identify certain items in an array that share a common characteristic.
  The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The map method allows items in an array to be manipulated to the userâ€™s preference, returning the conclusion of the chosen manipulation in an entirely new array. 




3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() will output a message in your console. It prints informartion for the user.
  return is usded to return a value from a function.

  Researched answer:The console.log() method writes a message to the console.
  The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is what is passed into the function.

  Researched answer: arguments is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is a technique that can help you develop better communication skills while coding. In pair programming one person drives, this person has control of the keyboard, while the second person is the navigator, this person reviews the work and communicates the next steps needed. 


  Researched answer: The driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the navigator. This approach requires constant communication. And talking about your code will make you a better developer and a better teammate. It is important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes and take frequent breaks.





6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD refers to a software development approach where tests are written before committing to write your code. 

  Researched answer: Test Driven Development There is another, and even more powerful benefit to writing tests for your code as well. When we write our tests first, then write the code required to make them pass, we as developers, are think about our code in a different, more logical way. Breaking the code into a series of tests helps us break the big problem down into much smaller ones, and smaller problems are easier to solve, so we write dramatically better code because of it.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Everything the instructors did this week was very helpful. I would say helping us during all challenges was one of the most helpful things during this week.
